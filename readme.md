## WordPress Preview Revisions :zap:

* The plugin is used to check the front-end preview of the older content revisions of a page/post, just as the preview mode is used in a current draft.
* Upon going to the revisions list, a preview button will be available to preview exactly how a page or post appeared in the selected version.
* *Note:* This has also been submitted as a feature in the core [ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57641). Once this gets merged into the core, you will no longer need the plugin.

## About :bulb:

* To enable editors to check and restore the previous content, whenever needed, WordPress has a handy `revisions` feature.
* However, the current limitation of the revisions feature is the lack of a `preview` option. While checking a previous revision, the editors can only see the content changes in the draft, but not the visual appearance of how it renders over the front end.
* To address the same, we have developed the `WordPress Preview Revisions` plugin, which enables the preview option for every revision, empowering the editors to take an informed call on what to restore.
